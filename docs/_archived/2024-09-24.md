ðŸ’¬ **Huancheng Zhou:** Deploying machine learning (ML) models on the data plane to enable real-time traffic analysis is a promising approach to managing the increasing volume of network traffic. Currently, researchers have offloaded simple supervised learning models (e.g., decision trees) to the programmable data plane. However, existing solutions require well-labeled datasets, which makes them less effective for general use cases. In this talk, I will introduce how to deploy unsupervised learning models on programmable switches. Additionally, I will discuss how to address resource constraints to improve the scalability of our intelligent data plane.
