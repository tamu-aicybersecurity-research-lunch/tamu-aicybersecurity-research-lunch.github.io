ðŸ’¬ **Dr. Zhikun Zhang:** Data is of paramount importance in today's digital age. However, the collection and utilization of data also raise significant privacy concerns. In this talk, I will discuss the
data privacy preservation issues through the lens of data life cycle, which consists of data
collection, data publication, data analysis, and data consumption phases. Concretely, I
will first introduce locally differentially private data collection in the data collection phase,
differentially private synthetic dataset generation in the data publication phase, privacy
risk assessment of machine learning systems used in the data analysis phase, and the
technical implementation of privacy-related laws (such as machine unlearning) in the
data consumption phase. I will then briefly introduce my current research in all these
topics.
