**Abstract:** AI-based chatbots like ChatGPT are widely used but present privacy risks as users may accidentally share sensitive information. Existing approaches, such as generalization, differential privacy, and federated learning, often involve trade-offs that reduce either the accuracy or the usability of the system. To address these challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving framework that combines local LLMs with deterministic rule-based methods to detect and anonymize sensitive data entirely on-device, reducing the risk of data leakage while maintaining functionality. We introduce a benchmark dataset with thousands of annotated test cases to evaluate privacy-preserving methods. We further demonstrate the practical application of this framework through a browser extension that anonymizes user input in real time, providing secure chatbot interactions. This work provides a scientifically grounded approach to improving privacy in AI-driven systems.
