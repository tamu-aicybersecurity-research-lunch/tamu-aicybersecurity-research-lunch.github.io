**Time:** 12:00pm - 1:00pm  
**Location:** PETR 414

**Abstract:** LLMs and generative AI have shown effectiveness in many software domains. Despite their issues with accuracy, hallucinations, nondeterminism, and limited context windows, LLMs are already demonstrating incredible results finding real software vulnerabilities today. We will explore how agent design and structuring of the vulnerability discovery process can overcome some of these limitations to find bugs in large codebases using LLMs. We will also discuss some of the ways that LLMs can work with traditional techniques for bug finding and why LLMs offer new possibilities for this area.

**BIO**: Tyler Nighswander works on software security research and development at Theori. He has been playing Capture The Flag contests since 2009 with Carnegie Mellon University's Plaid Parliament of Pwning, winning DEF CON CTF 9 times. Tyler was a member of the winning DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge team Mayhem in 2016, and was the lead for team Theori's 3rd place team at DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge in 2025. His research areas of interest include fuzzing, automatic bug finding, and reverse engineering.
