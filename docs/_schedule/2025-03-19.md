**Time:** 12:00pm - 1:00pm  
**Location:** PETR 214

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the ability to analyze and generate code nearly instantaneously, resulting in researchers and companies integrating LLMs across the hardware design and verification process. However, LLMs can also induce new attack scenarios within hardware development. One such threat not yet explored is intellectual property (IP) piracy, in which LLMs may be utilized to rewrite hardware designs to evade piracy detection. Furthermore, we propose LLMPirate, the first LLM-based technique able to generate pirated variations of circuit designs that successfully evade detection on 100% of tested circuits across multiple state-of-the-art piracy detection tools, even capable of pirating full processor designs.
