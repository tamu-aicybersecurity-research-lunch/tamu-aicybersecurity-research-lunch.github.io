**Time:** 12:00pm - 1:00pm  
**Location:** PETR 214

**Abstract:** Recent advances have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for fuzz driver generation (e.g., PromptFuzz) and commit-based fuzzing (e.g., WAFLGo). However, both approaches have significant limitations. PromptFuzz performs fuzzing by combining APIs but cannot effectively fuzz parts affected by commit changes. Additionally, PromptFuzz does not address the challenge of generating drivers for complex programs like Nginx. WAFLGo, on the other hand, supports commit-based fuzzing but performs poorly on inputs with strict structural requirements. This talk will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches and present preliminary experimental results using Nginx, demonstrating how controlling mutation regions can significantly improve the efficiency of fuzzing highly structured inputs.
