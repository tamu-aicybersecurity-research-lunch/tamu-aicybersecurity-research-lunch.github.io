**BIO**: Mabon Ninan is a first year PhD student working for Dr.Botacin, his research is focused on Machine Learning for Malware detection. This talk draws on his previous research conducted at the University of Cincinnati, where he focused on leveraging deep learning techniques to analyze and exploit side-channel attacks.

**Abstract:** A side-channel attack exploits information leaks such as power consumption, timing variations, or electromagnetic emissions to infer sensitive data from a system. In recent years, researchers have demonstrated that deep learning can offer significant advantages over traditional statistical-based attacks. However, further studies have shown that these attacks are highly sensitive to various discrepancies often overlooked that are crucial for understanding their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This talk takes a deep dive into both software and physical discrepancies, demonstrating their impact on side-channel attacks and their applicability in practical settings. With a key focus on portability, the talk aims to explore strategies for developing more robust and transferable attacks.
