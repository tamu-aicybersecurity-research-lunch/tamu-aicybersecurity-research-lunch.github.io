**Location:** PETR 414

**Abstract:** Hardware fuzzing has shown promise in detecting vulnerabilities in large-scale designs like modern processors. In the era of AI, a natural question arises: how can AI be leveraged to improve the efficiency of hardware fuzzing?

In this talk, Chen begins with a concise introduction to hardware fuzzing. He then frames AI techniques as two complementary roles for fuzzing: (1) search algorithms that guide test-generation and (2) learning algorithms that extract and reuse knowledge across designs.
Chen first introduces a family of AI-assisted fuzzers that utilize particle-swarm optimization, multi-armed bandits, and LLM+reinforcement Learning to select mutation strategies, prioritize inputs, and allocate testing resources.
He next describes the industrial processor design and verification flow, where design and test reuse are central principles, and shows how AI can add value while preserving the reuse trend.
Specifically, Chen highlights a missed opportunity: most advanced fuzzers are treated as advanced alternatives to random testing rather than as strategies for systematic knowledge reuse.
To address this gap, Chen introduces a contextual bandit-based approach that identifies and reuses highly effective tests from prior processors, improving fuzzing efficiency and accelerating vulnerability discovery on new processors.

**Speaker Bio:** Chen Chen is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, advised by Dr. Jeyavijayan (JV) Rajendran. He received his B.S. degree from Purdue University. His research focuses on hardware security. Chen has published papers in top-tier conferences, such as USENIX Security, DAC, ICCAD, and DATE. He is the recipient of the Distinguished Paper Award and the Distinguished Artifact Evaluation Reviewer Award at USENIX Security 2024. He also co-organizes HackTheSilicon, the world's largest hardware security capture-the-flag competitions, co-located with DAC, USENIX Security, CHES, and DATE.
