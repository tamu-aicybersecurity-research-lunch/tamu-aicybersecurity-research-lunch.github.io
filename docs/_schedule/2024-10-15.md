ðŸ’¬ **Dr. Cheng Zhang:**  Large-scale generative visual models have made content creation as little effort as writing a short text description. These models offer great potential but also pose substantial challenges in terms of reliability and ethics. Such challenges are primarily due to their learning from real-world data sources, which often contain inherent biases and imbalances. In this talk, I will try to address some questions: how can we efficiently remove bias from these models? How can we improve their controllability? And how can we better align them with user intent? Collectively, we move toward more reliable, secure, and responsible visual content creation.
