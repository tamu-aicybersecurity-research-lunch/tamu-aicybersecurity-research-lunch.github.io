**Time:** 12:00pm - 1:00pm  
**Location:** PETR 414

**Abstract:** Our team, All You Need Is A Fuzzing Brain, was one of seven finalists in DARPA’s Artificial Intelligence Cyber Challenge (AIxCC), placing fourth in the final round. During the competition, we developed a Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) that autonomously discovered 28 security vulnerabilities—including six previously unknown zero-days—in real-world open-source C and Java projects, and successfully patched 14 of them. The complete CRS is open source at github.com/o2lab/afc-crs-all-you-need-is-a-fuzzing-brain.

This paper provides a detailed technical description of our CRS, with an emphasis on its LLM-powered components and strategies. Building on AIxCC, we further introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on vulnerability detection and patching tasks, derived from the AIxCC dataset. The leaderboard is available at o2lab.github.io/FuzzingBrain-Leaderboard.
