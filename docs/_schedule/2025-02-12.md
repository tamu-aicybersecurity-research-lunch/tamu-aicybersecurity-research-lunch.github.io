**Speaker Bio:** Bryson Brown graduated from the Air Force Academy with a bachelors in Cyber Science and am working on his Masters in Computer Science. He is currently researching the applications of LLMs to create datasets for code vulnerability detection.

**Time:** 12:00pm - 1:00pm  
**Location:** PETR 214

**Abstract:** Vulnerabilities have long plagued software and are the root cause of many cyber attacks. Finding software vulnerabilities using artificial intelligence has been of great interest to researchers and businesses alike, but much of the research in the field has been hamstrung by a lack of quality data. Most existing datasets are constructed with previously written human code that is then labeled. This paper focuses on the viability of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create vulnerable code to make a suitable dataset. Our LLM prompts successfully created 20,000 vulnerable and non-vulnerable C code samples across 13 Common Weakness and Enumerations (CWE) with a 98% label accuracy rate. Preliminary results show that LLMs fine tuned on this dataset struggle to transfer to other datasets.
