**Time:** 12:00pm - 1:00pm  
**Location:** PETR 414

**Abstract:** Modern web applications increasingly rely on complex client-side logic and stateful multi-request workflows that fundamentally challenge traditional black-box security testing approaches. Existing web application scanners achieve poor code coverage and miss critical vulnerability classes due to the lack of understanding in application state transitions and client-driven logic flows. We present DeepStitch, which leverages LLM-driven logic reconstruction and client-side instrumentation to understand how the application is structured. By inferring hidden application workflows from client-side observations, DeepStitch enables discovery of complex vulnerability chains that require multi-step exploits. In the evaluation of the popular GitHub repositories, DeepStitch discovered 7 previously unknown vulnerabilities. These results establish DeepStitch as a significant advancement in automated web security testing.

**Speaker Bio:** Jianwei is a Ph.D. student in SUCCESS Lab in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University. His research interests focus on System Security & Web Security. Besides that, he is active in finding vulnerabilities in various applications.
